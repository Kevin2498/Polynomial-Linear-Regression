# Polynomial-Linear-Regression
An employee is about to join a company and HR Manager wants to find out whether the annual salary i.e 160k, which was provided to him by his previous company is similar to what he say is.

HR Manager gets the data from previous company but in the form of levels and the corresponding pay and was also informd that the respective employee was working as the Region Manager for the past two years and to get promoted from Region Manager to Partner requires a minimum of 4 years of experience as the Region Manager. The HR Manager hence comes to a conclusion in the matter of his current pay level = 6.5  

HR Manager uses Polynomial Linear Regression model to find out whether the employee is bluffing or telling the truth. If he's bluffing he won't be hired and if he's telling the truth he'll be hired and given some extra incentives for his truthfullness.

Try out this project to know whether he is hired or not !!!

This what will happen if we try to fit this problem onto Linear Regression Model

## From here you'll see our prediction getting optimised

Seems like that Employee was telling the truth, accounding to our model we predicted the annual salary of the person who is in 6.5 pay scale as = 158862.45.
