# Polynomial-Linear-Regression
An employee is about to join a company and HR Manager wants to find out whether the annual salary i.e 160k which was provided to him from his previous company is similar to what he say it is.

HR Manager gets the data from previous company but in the form of levels and the corresponding pay and was also informd that the respective employee was working as the Region Manager for the past two years and to get promoted from Region Manager to Partner requires a minimum of 4 years of experience as the Region Manager. The HR Manager hence comes to a conclusion in the matter of his current pay level = 6.5  

HR Manager uses Polynomial Linear Regression model to find out whether the employee is bluffing or telling the truth. If he's bluffing he won't be hired and if he's telling the truth he'll be hired and given some extra incentives for his truthfullness.

Try out this project to know whether he is hired or not !!!
